## Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Audio System Enhancement ✅
- [x] Implement AudioManager with Web Audio API
- [x] Create dynamic fighting theme with chord progressions
- [x] Add sound effects for all combat actions:
  - [x] Punch sounds (light attacks)
  - [x] Kick sounds (heavy attacks)
  - [x] Special move sounds (projectiles)
  - [x] Hit impact sounds
  - [x] Block deflection sounds
  - [x] Victory fanfare
- [x] Integrate audio controls into UI
  - [x] Master volume slider
  - [x] Sound effects volume slider
  - [x] Real-time volume adjustment
- [x] Audio timing integration with game events

## Testing Phase
- [x] Install dependencies
- [x] Build application with audio system
- [x] Start server
- [x] API testing (not applicable - client-side game)
- [x] Full game functionality testing
- [x] Audio system testing
- [x] Mobile responsiveness testing
- [x] Performance validation

## Completion
- [x] Final polish and optimization
- [x] Audio system fully integrated
- [x] Documentation update
- [x] User preview ready with full audio experience ✅
